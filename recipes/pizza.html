            <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>1 ⅓ cups very warm water (120 degrees F to 130 degrees F)</li>

        </ul>

            <li>1 6 ounce package of pepperoni</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese or more to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Directions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>For sauce: Combine all sauce ingredients with 1/2 cup water in a medium bowl; set aside for flavors to develop while making crust. Freeze remaining paste .</li>
            <br>
            <li>For crusts: Combine 2 cups of flour with the dry yeast, sugar and salt. Add the water and oil and mix until well blended (about 1 minute). Gradually add enough remaining flour slowly, until a soft, sticky dough ball is formed.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Knead for about 4 minutes, on a floured surface, until dough is smooth and elastic. Add more flour, if needed. (If using RapidRise® Yeast, let dough rest, covered, for 10 minutes.)</li>
            <br>
            <li>Divide dough in half. Pat each half (with floured hands) into a 12-inch greased pizza pan OR roll dough to fit pans.</li>
            <br>
            <li>For pizzas: Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Top crusts with sauce, pepperoni and cheese.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Bake for 18 to 20 minutes until crusts are browned and cheese is bubbly. For best results, rotate pizza pans between top and bottom oven racks halfway through baking.</li>
        </ol>
